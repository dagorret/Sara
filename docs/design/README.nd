# 📐 Design Decisions — SARA

This section documents the **core architectural decisions** behind SARA.  
The goal is to make the system understandable, justifiable, and maintainable in an academic and institutional context.

These documents explain *why* certain technologies and patterns were chosen, not just *how* they are used.

---

## 🔑 Guiding principles

All design decisions in SARA are guided by the following principles:

- Reproducibility by construction
- Immutability of data
- Explicit versioning
- Reasonable scalability (academic / professional scale)
- Simplicity of deployment
- Pedagogical transparency

## 📂 Design documents

### 1️⃣ Why DuckDB
**Analytical engine**

Explains why DuckDB is used as the embedded analytical engine instead of pandas, SQLite, PostgreSQL, or big data platforms.

Key topics:
- Analytical (OLAP) focus
- Direct querying of Parquet
- Low memory footprint
- Embedded and serverless architecture
- Suitability for teaching and reproducibility

➡️ See: `why-duckdb.md`

---

### 2️⃣ Why Parquet
**Data storage format**

Explains why Apache Parquet is used for dataset storage and versioning.

Key topics:
- Columnar storage
- Compression and encoding
- Analytical workload optimization
- Interoperability and longevity
- Natural fit for immutable dataset versions

➡️ See: `why-parquet.md`

---

### 3️⃣ Why immutable datasets
**Reproducibility and auditability**

Explains why datasets are never edited in place and why every transformation produces a new version.

Key topics:
- Reproducibility guarantees
- Lineage tracking
- Error prevention
- Alignment with scientific workflows

➡️ (to be added)

---

### 4️⃣ Why SQL-first analytics
**Transparency and pedagogy**

Explains why SARA relies on SQL as the core analytical language.

Key topics:
- Auditability
- Teachability
- Explicit analytical steps
- Separation of data logic and UI

➡️ (to be added)

---

### 5️⃣ Why not notebooks (initially)
**Controlled analytical workflows**

Explains why notebooks are not part of the initial core and how they may be integrated later in a controlled way.

Key topics:
- Reproducibility risks
- Version control
- Educational clarity
- Future roadmap (Super Pro mode)

➡️ (to be added)

## 🧭 How to read these documents

- These documents are **not tutorials**.
- They are meant to justify architectural choices to:
  - instructors,
  - researchers,
  - contributors,
  - institutional reviewers.

They are intentionally conservative and avoid experimental or hype-driven arguments.

---

## 🏁 Summary

SARA’s architecture is designed to:

- support real statistical and econometric work,
- remain understandable by non-specialists,
- scale within realistic academic constraints,
- ensure that results can always be reproduced and audited.

Design decisions are documented explicitly to avoid implicit assumptions and hidden complexity.
